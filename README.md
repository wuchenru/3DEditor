# Simple 3D Editor

## Overview

The **Simple 3D Editor** is a basic C++ application designed to help users create and manipulate 3D objects in a simulated environment. The project focuses on core C++ concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP), memory management, data structures, and geometric algorithms. 

This editor supports basic operations like creating 3D objects, moving, scaling, and rotating them, with user interaction through keyboard input.

## Features
- **Object Representation**: Create and manage 3D objects (e.g., cubes).
- **Object Manipulation**: Move objects along the X, Y, and Z axes using keyboard input (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`).
- **Simple Rendering**: Print the position of objects in the console.
- **Memory Management**: Dynamically allocate and deallocate memory for objects.
- **Object Management**: Store and manage multiple objects using a vector, with the ability to sort objects by position.

## Requirements
- **C++14 or later** for compiling.
- Basic C++ setup with a terminal/command line environment.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the project using a C++ compiler (`g++` or similar).
3. Run the resulting executable.
4. Use the keyboard to interact with the objects (move them in 3D space).

## Goals
The project is designed to:
- Teach the fundamentals of C++ and object-oriented programming.
- Help practice working with dynamic memory and data structures.
- Provide an introduction to geometric transformations and simple simulation concepts.

## Planned Enhancements
- Add more 3D shapes (e.g., spheres).
- Implement more advanced transformations (scaling, rotation).
- Enhance rendering with a GUI in future iterations.
